# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. These guides describe how OctoAcme runs projectsâ€”from initial idea through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement.

**Core Processes:**
- **Initiation:** Validate the business need, define success criteria, and align stakeholders
- **Planning:** Scope work, allocate resources, map milestones, and identify dependencies
- **Execution:** Build, test, track progress, and iterate based on feedback
- **Risk Management:** Identify risks early, maintain a risk register, and escalate as needed
- **Release & Deployment:** Deploy with quality gates, verify outcomes, and communicate to stakeholders
- **Continuous Improvement:** Run retrospectives, capture learnings, and track action items

**Principles:**
- **Iterative delivery:** Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership:** Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Data-driven decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage open feedback and continuous learning

**Key Roles:**
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers:** Implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals

**Key Artifacts:**
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
